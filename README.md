🛍️ Project Title: ARTTIFAI TECH - E-Commerce Cart System
📌 Project Description:
The ARTTIFAI TECH E-Commerce Cart System is a full-stack web application designed to provide users with a seamless and responsive online shopping experience. Developed as part of a Full Stack Development internship project, this system integrates a modern front-end interface with a robust back-end and secure database management.
